							On March 19 Governor Newsom issued a statewide Stay at Home order
							to confront the growing coronavirus outbreak in California.
							Residents are ordered to stay at home except for essential needs
							and should practice social distancing in public. You can learn

							To help those in our community who use a bicycle as their primary
							mode of transportation, or for exercise, The Cub House is
							remaining open for essential bike service only. The safety of our
							employees and customers is, and will continue to be, our top
							priority as we navigate this uncertain time. In order to provide
							this service in a safe environment we have implemented strict new
							protocols for employees within the work space and for our
							interactions with customers. We ask that you review all the
							information on this website carefully and respect the plan that
							we’ve outlined.
						</p>
						<p>
							Any and all of this can change at any time. We will keep this
							space up-to-date with our current procedures and you can follow us
							on instagram
							<a href="https://www.instagram.com/itsnotabikeshop/"
								>@itsnotabikeshop</a

						<h3 class="pt-4">Repair Drop-off and Pick-up</h3>
						<ul class="mt-3 mb-5 pb-4">
							<li>
								You must have an appointment, we are not offering drop-in
								service at this time. Contact us via text/call
								<a href="tel:+16267553003">(626) 755-3003</a> or email
								<a href="mailto:info@cubhouse.cc">info@cubhouse.cc</a> to set up
								a time.
							</li>
							<li>
								Show up on time for your appointment. If you are late, or fail
								to show, you must contact us to reschedule.
							</li>
							<li>
								When you arrive, wait outside the front gate. We will meet you
								there to discuss your repair while maintaining a minimum 6ft
								distance.
							</li>
							<li>
								If you are dropping off a bike we ask that you place it in the
								stand provided and we’ll take it from there.
							</li>
							<li>
								If you are picking up a bike we will place it back in the same
								stand outside the gate after you have paid.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Generally</h3>
						<ul class="mt-3 mb-5 pb-3">
							<li>
								Appointments help us limit the number of people on-site,
								reducing the risk of exposure to our employees and customers.
								Make an appointment.
							</li>
							<li>
								At this time no customers are allowed to enter the front gate.
								If you require parts with your service we will bring out options
								to show you.
							</li>
							<li>
								Please, no cash payments. To limit contact we’d prefer you pay
								prior to pickup. We will email you an invoice to be paid online
								when your bike is ready, but if necessary we accept apple pay or
								credit card on-site.
							</li>
							<li>
								We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone who does not
								abide by the safety precautions we’ve outlined here.
